## Review if helpful: An Introduction to Node.js on sitepoint.com

How would you describe Node to a non-technical friend?
Node.js is a program we can use to execute JavaScript on our computers. In other words, it’s a JavaScript runtime.

What does it mean that Node is a JavaScript runtime?
this means that you can write your JavaScript using the latest and most modern syntax. It also means that you don’t generally have to worry about compatibility issues — as you would if you were writing JavaScript that would run in different browsers.

What is Node used for?
Node comes with build tools that are designed to automate the process of developing a modern JS application. These build tools come in all shapes and sizes, and you won’t get far in a modern JavaScript landscape without bumping into them. They can be used for anything from bundling your JavaScript files and dependencies into static assets, to running tests, or automatic code linting and style checking.
